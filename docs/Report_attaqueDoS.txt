Attack â€“ HTTP Slowloris (DoS)

Target: Local Python HTTP server (http.server) running on localhost:8080  
Method: 1000 incomplete HTTP/1.1 requests with periodic keep-alive headers  
Tool: Custom Python script (slowloris_attack.py)  
Traffic Captured: Wireshark filtered on tcp.port == 8080  
Observed Effect:
- Before attack: 
*response time = 71 ms
*curl responded instantly (HTTP 200 OK)
- During attack: 
*response time = 1132 ms
*Several requests failed with: ConnectionAbortedError [WinError 10053]
*Server closed many sockets due to overload

Conclusion:
The HTTP server experienced clear performance degradation and
abnormal connection termination. This confirms a successful
application-layer Denial of Service (DoS) using a Slowloris-style 
attack. The impact was measurable through increased response time
and aborted client connections.
